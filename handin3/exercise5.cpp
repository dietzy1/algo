/* (Week 6) Consider the following strategy for sorting N numbers in an array A: find
the smallest element of A and exchange it with the element in A[0]. Then find the
second smallest element of A and exchange it with A[1]. Continue in this manner
for the first N âˆ’ 1 elements of A. Extend the test sort.h file with a template
implementation of this algorithm (i.e. it can take a vector with a generic element
type), which is known as selection sort. Give the best-case and worst-case running
times for the resulting algorithm.
